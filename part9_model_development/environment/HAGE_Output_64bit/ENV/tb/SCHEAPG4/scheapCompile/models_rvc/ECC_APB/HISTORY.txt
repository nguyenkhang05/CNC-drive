- Supported features:
  + Error notification: 
    ECC Error:
     • Error notification can be either enabled or disabled upon detection of an ECC 2-bit error in data.
     • Error notification can be either enabled or disabled upon detection of an ECC 1-bit error in data.
     • Error notification can be either enabled or disabled upon detection of an ECC 2-bit error in address.
     • Error notification can be either enabled or disabled upon detection of an ECC 1-bit error in address.
     In the initial state, error notification is enabled upon detection of an ECC 2-bit error in data,
     ECC 1-bit error in data, ECC 2-bit error in address, ECC 1-bit error in address.
    Overflow Error:
     • Error notification can be either enabled or disabled if a second error occurs
     while either of the error flags in the error status register is set, 
     except when both the error address and source of the second error are the same as those of the first error.
  + Error status: 
    A status register is provided, which indicates the statuses of ECC 2-bit error in data detection, 
    ECC 1-bit error in data detection, ECC 2-bit error in address detection, ECC 1-bit error in address detection. 
    If an error occurs while no error status is set, the corresponding status is set. 
    The error status can be cleared using the clear register.
  + Address capture: 
    The address is captured when an ECC 2-bit error in data detection, ECC 1-bit error in data detection,
    ECC 2-bit error in address is detected. The error status serves as the enable bit of the capture address.
    Captured address is updated if the error status is cleared.
    There is 1 register to capture error-address.

- Non-supported features and limitation:
  + Not support Encoder and Decoder. Error input is modelled in Python I/F 
  (ECC_APB_SetErrorAddr command and ECC_APB_IssueError command)
  + Not support test function (test mode)
