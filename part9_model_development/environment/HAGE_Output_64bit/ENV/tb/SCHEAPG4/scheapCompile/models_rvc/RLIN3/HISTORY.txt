- Fix time resolution bug
  - Symptom: the operation is not correct when using a time resolution that is not nano second (SC_NS).
  - Cause: current code use "sc_time_stamp().to_double()", its result is based on time resolution.
  - How to fix: add GetCurTime() function, to change other time resolution to nano second (SC_NS)
  - How to check: add new test patterns tp08_01_001, tp08_02_001, tp08_03_001 (based on tp05_04_05_001)
                                        tp08_01_002, tp08_02_002, tp08_03_002 (based on tp05_04_06_001)
