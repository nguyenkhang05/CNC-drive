v2018_02_28
  - Update source code to fix segmentation fault on SC-HEAP (gcc issue related to double)

v2017_11_16
  - Remove the use of mutex in implementation (adc.h and adc.cpp)

v2017_10_24
  - Update adc.h due to below compiling issue on Windows 64bits:
        --------
          adc.h(255): error C3646: 'm_mutex': unknown override specifier ...
          adc.h(255): error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int  ...
          adc.cpp(156): error C2065: 'm_mutex': undeclared identifier ...

v2017_07_25
  - Update features to support RH850/E2x-FCC2

v2015_05_18 (fixed issue of ticket #36503)
  - Updated constrain of writing VCR
    + VCR.GCTRL can be written when:
      ++ The related scan group is in ADC mode ADCFnVCRj.CNVCLS[2:0] = 0H (Normal A/D conversion) or = 3H (Diagnosis) or = 4H (Normal A/D conversion in addition mode)
      ++ Confirm for the related scan group that ADSTARTE = 0H
      ++ Confirm for the related scan group that TRGMD = 0H
      ++ Confirm for the related scan group that SGACT = 0H
  - Fixed issue of setting HLDTE (cannot set to 1 when TRGMD != 0)
    + Fixed to allow HLDTE is set from 0 to 1 when TRGMD == 1

  - Add features of RH850/E2x enhancement

v2016_06_20
  - Update in RH850/E2x enhancement (update HWM)
    + Change address of SGVCOWRx to 4B4H

    + Add write condition to some specific registers.
    + Add condition that EVCC can be guaranteed in 5V
    + Add restriction that using DFMT = 1 is prohibited in case of using DFE, ASF, IFC

v2016_10_26
- Fix time resolution bug
  - Symptom: the operation is not correct when using a time resolution that is not nano second (SC_NS).
  - Cause: current code use "sc_time_stamp().to_double()", its result is based on time resolution.
  - How to fix: add GetCurTime() function, to change other time resolution to nano second (SC_NS)
  - How to check: add new test patterns tp03_04_03_003_restime_fs, tp03_04_03_003_restime_ps (based on tp03_04_03_003).

v2016_11_09
  - Correct the order of test patterns (SC_FS and SC_PS) in sim/scripts_windows/run.bat
  - Update the expected log of tp03_04_03_003_restime_ps in Windows env
  - Remove redundant commands in sim/scripts_linux/run_all/run_all.csh
  - Revise env path of sim/scripts_linux/astc_env_rvc_set.csh and sim/scripts_linux/env_rvc_set.csh
